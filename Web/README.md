# Web

The WebGL content for rendering the AR scene.

The setup is fairly minimal to allow you the developer to use your prefered WebGL authoring approach.  

# Tasks

* `yarn start` - Start the dev server. *Note `.env` needs to be created first*
* `yarn tunnel` - Start an ngrok connection for live development when the iOS app has been launched

Check package.json for the rest

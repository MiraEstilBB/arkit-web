# Web

The setup is fairly minimal to allow you the developer to use your prefered WebGL authoring approach.

## Installation

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `component-arkit-web/Web` directory
2. If you don't have `yarn` globally run `npm i yarn --global`
3. Install the project dependencies by running `yarn`

## Tasks

* `yarn start` - Start the dev server. *Note `.env` needs to be created first*
* `yarn tunnel` - Start an ngrok connection for live development

Check package.json for the rest

## Demos

* [Anchors](src/js/demos/index/README.md)
* [Shadows](src/js/demos/shadows/README.md)
* [Bubbles](src/js/demos/bubbles/README.md)

## Debugging

Use the Safari Technology Preview inspector to view the console logs.
